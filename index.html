        <h2>Result of the meeting: </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The meeting was a very successful kickoff that showed lots of promise with our group. We very quickly got our beginning ideas of what people wanted out of this project and formed our theme as well</p></li>
          <li><p>We decided that our team mascot would be the <span style="color:purple">purple</span> alien thanos from the <em>avengers movies.</em></p></li>
          <li>We also decided what our preferred way of communication is: <i>Slack</i></li>
          <li>We also went over our finished video and what we liked about it</li>
          <li>We went over the group policy agreements</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <p>My top 3 take aways from this meeting were: </p>
          <li>  Everyone in my group seems very intelligent, and I have no doubt that we will enjoy working with each other</li>
          <li>  A couple people in the industy have expressed their dread for meetings, but I actually enjoy ones like this</li>
          <li>  How varied people are in their programming experience despite being <b>mostly</b> the same year and in the same class with the <strong>same prerequisites (good thing)</strong></li>
        </ol>
