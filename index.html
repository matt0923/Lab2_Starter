        <h2>Result of the meeting: </h2>
        <p>The meeting was a very successful kickoff that showed lots of promise with our group. We very quickly got our beginning ideas of what people wanted out of this project and formed our theme as well</p>
        <p>We decided that our team mascot would be the <span style="color:purple">purple</span> alien thanos from the avengers movies.</p>
